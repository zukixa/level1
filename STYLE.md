### Maze Game Project Style Guide

This style guide provides essential guidelines for coding conventions to ensure consistency, maintainability, and readability across the Maze Game project.

#### File Naming Conventions

- **Descriptive Names**: Choose names that reflect the file's purpose, such as `maze_builder.py` or `player_manager.py`.
- **Lowercase with Underscores**: Use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words.

#### Variable and Function Naming

- **Self-explanatory**: Names should clearly indicate their purpose or contents.
- **Conventions**:
  - **Variables**: Use `snake_case` for variables, e.g., `current_position`, `maze_size`.
  - **Functions**: Also use `snake_case` for function names, e.g., `create_maze()`, `move_player()`.

#### Indentation and Spacing

- **Use of Tabs**: Employ 1 tab per indentation level to maintain consistency across different development environments.
- **Method Separation**: Separate method definitions with two blank lines.
- **Logical Separation Within Methods**: Use one blank line to separate blocks of code within methods for better readability.

#### Commenting Strategy

- **Purpose of Comments**: Comments should explain why specific approaches or logic were used, not what the code does. The code should be self-explanatory.
- **Placement**: Place comments above the code block they pertain to.
- **Content and Style**:
  - Begin with a capital letter.
  - Use complete sentences ending with a period.
  - Keep comments concise while providing necessary insight.

#### A Simplified Example in Python

```py
# Function to check if the move is valid within the maze boundaries

def is_valid_move(x, y, max_x, max_y):
    """
    Checks whether the proposed move stays within the maze's boundaries.

    Parameters:
    x (int): Current x-coordinate.
    y (int): Current y-coordinate.
    max_x (int): Maximum allowable x-coordinate.
    max_y (int): Maximum allowable y-coordinate.

    Returns:
    bool: True if move is within boundaries, else False.
    """
    return 0 <= x < max_x and 0 <= y < max_y
```

#### Summary

Following the guidelines outlined in this document will help ensure that the code is accessible and easily understood by all team members. \
This unified approach to coding practices will support the seamless integration of various components and foster an environment of effective collaboration.
